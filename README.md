# A-B-Test-for-Round-Roasters-
Here's my workflow for an A/B test carried out for a hypothetical coffee shop chain called Round Roasters. Our Coffee shop wants to add two new items to the menu and run Tv ads as well, this means we would need to pump up our marketing budget. However, the management doesn't know what the Return on Investment will be if it makes this move. To find out, I used A/B testing to measure the impact of this change on profitability. Our analysis shows the exact percentage increase in Gross Margin if this change is made and through this analysis I was able to confirm for a fact that making the change would be a profitable move and is worth the investment.
